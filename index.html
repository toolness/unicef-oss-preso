    <h1>UNICEF&mdash;Developing in the open</h1>

    <h2>Best practices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a changelog</a> to help stakeholders and community members keep up with your project without having to read every commit.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/blog/1124-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github">Open a Pull Request as early as possible</a> - "Pull Requests are a great way to start a conversation of a feature, so start
        one as soon as possible-even before you are finished with the code. Your
        team can comment on the feature as it evolves, instead of providing all
        their feedback at the very end." Aside from being a great development practice, it can also be a great way to work in the open
        and co-build with your community.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous integration</a> - Services like <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and <a href="https://circleci.com/">Circle CI</a> are free for open-source projects, and can be a great way to reduce friction for new contributors.</li>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3">Write a great README</a> - <a href="https://github.com/shayc/cboard#readme">CBoard's README</a> is a great example.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Empathizing with contributors</h2>
