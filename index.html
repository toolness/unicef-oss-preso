    <h2>Best practices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a changelog</a> to help stakeholders and community members keep up with your project without having to read every commit.</li>
      <li><a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a> is a low-bandwidth way of quickly communicating to stakeholders (both humans and API clients) what has changed in your project.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/blog/1124-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github">Open a Pull Request as early as possible</a> - "Pull Requests are a great way to start a conversation of a feature, so start
        one as soon as possible-even before you are finished with the code. Your
        team can comment on the feature as it evolves, instead of providing all
        their feedback at the very end." Aside from being a great development practice, it can also be a great way to work in the open
        and co-build with your community.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/avoid-jargon/">Avoid jargon</a> - Going beyond necessary technical terms to write in jargon can alienate potential contributors; especially those with who may have valuable expertise to contribute to your project, but who may be unfamiliar with some aspect of it.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous integration</a> - Services like <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and <a href="https://circleci.com/">Circle CI</a> are free for open-source projects, and can be a great way to reduce friction for new contributors.</li>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3">Write a great README</a> - <a href="https://github.com/shayc/cboard#readme">CBoard's README</a> is a great example.</li>
      <li><a href="https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/">Establish a code of conduct</a> to foster healthy and constructive community behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Empathizing with contributors</h2>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Maintaining an open-source project is like being a Flight Attendant for an airline where all tickets are free and the majority of customer surveys offer suggestions on how to fly the airplane.</p>&mdash; Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/958349496076742658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2018</a></blockquote>

      <li><a href="https://opensource.guide/">opensource.guide</a> is a set of guides by GitHub on starting an open source project, finding users for it, leadership and governance, and more.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/the-case-for-open-source-design-can-design-by-committee-work/">The Case For Open-Source Design: Can Design By Committee Work?</a>
